# TensorflowSubclassingAndCustomLayer

If we have a block of layers that are being repeatedly used such as CNN -> BatchNormalization -> Relu then we can use the concept of subclassing.
We initialize a class CNNBlock and create 2 methods in it. 
1) __init__ 2) call

Reconstructed Resnet like structure.

Created Dense Layer from Scratch.


Trained all the created models on MNIST dataset.

Custom Model.fit for MNIST dataset
